My name is **Chai Liang** (Chinese characthers: **柴亮**).  

I am currently working in the [Media Innovation Lab of HUAWEI CLOUD](https://www.huaweicloud.com/lab/multimedia/home.html)(July 2023 ~ now), which was selected by the joint development program of South China University of Technology and HUAWEI. I will complete my master's thesis and obtain my master's degree here.  

I have studied computer science courses at [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/), South China University of Technology, including software architecture theory and practice, advanced artificial intelligence Visual Computing and so on(Sep 2022 ~ June 2023). During this time, I worked on evolutionary algorithms in [Computational Intelligence Lab](http://www.dsail.vip/PersonInCharge.html). Prior to this, I studied for my bachelor's degree at [School of Automation](https://automation.gdut.edu.cn/), Guangdong University of Technology(Sep 2018 ~ June 2022). During this time, I worked on Computer Vision in [Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and System Integration of IoT,Ministry of Education](https://iipiot.gdut.edu.cn/index.htm),Guangdong University of Technology.
